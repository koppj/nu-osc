Updates to SBL code:
- adjust #define PATH in definitions.h to ./sbl/
- Make declaration of "Fit fit" in class_react-fit.cc non-extern
- Same with "Flux flux" in class_react-flux.cc
- Optional: Add definition of Ip3pI to definitions.h
- Optional: Update dm2k to produce more useful error messages
- Replace
    if (logD > LDM2MAX) logD = LDM2MAX;
  by
    if (logD > LDM2MAX-1.00001*DM_STEP) logD = LDM2MAX-1.00001*DM_STEP; // JK
  for the 1+3+1 case. This has to be done in bugey.cc, cdhs.cc, karmen.cc,
  lsnd.cc, minib-anti.cc, miniboone.cc, nomad.cc sbl_reactors.cc
  (and possibly other files)
- Implement temporary fix for th14=0.0 problem in lsnd.cc
