Updates to SBL code (2011 version):
- adjust #define PATH in definitions.h to ./sbl/
- Make declaration of "Fit fit" in class_react-fit.cc non-extern
- Same with "Flux flux" in class_react-flux.cc
- Optional: Add definition of Ip3pI to definitions.h
- Optional: Update dm2k to produce more useful error messages
- Replace
    if (logD > LDM2MAX) logD = LDM2MAX;
  by
    if (logD > LDM2MAX-1.00001*DM_STEP) logD = LDM2MAX-1.00001*DM_STEP; // JK
  for the 1+3+1 case. This has to be done in bugey.cc, cdhs.cc, karmen.cc,
  lsnd.cc, minib-anti.cc, miniboone.cc, nomad.cc sbl_reactors.cc
  (and possibly other files)
- Implement temporary fix for th14=0.0 problem in lsnd.cc


Adjustment for reactor code (2012 version):
- Remove reactor-related stuff from old sbl/ directory
  (remove also minimize-simplex library)
- Add new reactors/ directory to Makefile (also in the linker call)
- Create Make in reactors/ directory and add all object files
  (corresponding to all .cc files)
- Rename main() function in main.cc to reactor_main to avoid two main's
- Add namespacing environment to every .cc file and .h in reactors/
  to wrap class, function, and variable declarations
- Update SBL reactor initialization and chi^2 calls in prior.cc
  Be careful: Thomas' code doesn't accept inverted hierarchy parameters
- Adjust paths in reactor code wherever external data is loaded
- Define appropriate USE_XXX directives in definitions.h
- Optional: Change LDM2MIN and LDM2MAX in bugey.cc to +-2.0
- Replace p.dmq[2] ---> fabs(p.dmq[2])  in chooz.cc and dc.cc to allow
  for inverted hierarchy
