Apr 28, 2011 - Joachim Kopp
- Fixed bug in implementation of energy resolution: Was constant, should be
  proportional to sqrt(E/GeV)

Jul 23, 2010 - Joachim Kopp
- Switched to new LBNE fluxes for 120 GeV beam

Feb 4, 2010 - Joachim Kopp
- Changed prefactor of some backgrounds in appearance channels from 0.8 to 0.85

Feb 4, 2010 - Joachim Kopp
- Background normalization error in \nu_e appearance channels changed
  from 0.1 to 0.022 (= Systematic error from MicroBooNE proposal)

Feb 2, 2010 - Joachim Kopp
- Energy resolution changed to \sigma_E = 0.15 * sqrt(E/GeV) GeV
- Signal efficiencies changed to 85%
- Far detector mass is now a variable

Jan 12, 2010 - Joachim Kopp
- Switched to FNAL based WBB
- Removed QE channels and rules following email exchange with
  M. Bishai on Jan, 12, 2010


Original file based on work by Mary Bishai.
Here is the header from Mary's original file:
  This file describes a MASS kt Liquid Argon TPC detector in the BNL WBB band beam.
  The analysis here completely neglected the impact of the second peak
  in the beam. It includes, however, all beam related backgrounds:
  NC, nu_e, bar_nu_e, nu_mu, bar_nu_mu
  
  Beware: the x-sections are different with respect to the WBB files
  (20% different rates, just by that)
  
  I removed all NC background (I have no migration matrices and no pi0
  x-sections). Efficiency is no 80%. The energy resolution for QE is 5%
  
  This file uses the CC/QE seperation as 'JHFHKAll.glb'

Note on the normalization factors

NOTE: Conversion from pot to time according to LBNE baseline design for CDR:
   FNAL beam 7.3 x 10^20 POT per year (708kW, 1.98e7s per yr, 120GeV)
(information from Lisa Whitehead, 13 Aug 2010)

At 120 GeV: 2.3 MW are equivalent to
  2.3e6 J/s / (1.6e-19 eV/J) / (120e9 eV/pot) * 1.98e7 s/yr * 3 yr
    = 71e20 pot

Event rate [Neutrinos/GeV] =
   flux @ 1300 km [Neutrinos/GeV/pot/m^2] * 1300^2
 * 10^-38 * 10^-4 m^2/cm^2 * cross section [10^-38 cm^2]
 * Number of pot
 * 6.02e32 nucleons/kt * Detector mass [kt]

==> @norm = 1300^2  *  10^-38*10^-4  *  10^20  *  6.02e32
          = 1300^2  *  6.02 * 10^10
          = 1.017e17

The normalization factor from the LBNE file is
  5.19*7.504*10^12*1300*1300/120.0 / 5.202 = 1.054e17
