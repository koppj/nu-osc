- Make plot of Ue4 vs. Um4 for ATM.

- Understand why including ATM_COMP rather than ATM_TAB changes the PG
  test by so much.

- RENO ND spectrum?

- Understand differences between my MINOS code and Michele's

- MINOS seems to have large impact on tension in 3+2, but not so much
in 3+1, see Thomas' email from Sep 23, 2011, 8:30 am.

- Try to understand good PG for app vs. disapp in the 1+3+1 case (but
not the 3+2 case)

- Study consistency of app and disapp evidence, e.g. by plotting chi^2
marginalized vs. dmsq.

- What are the artifacts in the Um4-Ut4 plots at high CL?

- Counting of degrees of freedom in MB?

- Write summary of MINOS analysis

- Study impact of sterile neutrinos on th23 (deviation from maximal)

- Using Thomas' code, "all except KamLAND" gives worse limit than
SBL+BUGEY_SP. Is this related to th13 fixed? Plot in th13-th14 plane
for fixed dm41?

Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------

- Differences of our results compared to Giunti-Laveder:
--> see my email from 2012-06-12

- Using Thomas' code, "all except KamLAND" gives worse limit than
SBL+BUGEY_SP. Is this related to th13 fixed? Plot in th13-th14 plane
for fixed dm41?
--> It appears that some of the LBL reactor experiments have a preference
for *larger* th14. I tried setting th13 to 0, and the preferred region
for "all except KamLAND" moves to even larger th14 (by a small amount).
Plotting the allowed region in th13 vs th14 (for dm41 = 5. eV^2) does not
reveal anything unusual.

- Why is solar more constraining for th13 than for th14.
(Matter effects?)
--> Is it really more constraining? Looking at the exclusion plot in
the th13--th14 plane, it seems to me that the two limits are similar
(note that we plot sin^2 \theta_{14}, but \sin^2 2\theta_{13}!

- Why do null-app results seem to prefer, at low confidence,
non-zero theta?
--> Cannot reproduce this claim any more.

- Understand why atm depends on th34 in Thomas' 2007 paper, but not for us
--> Michele's ATM code can do *either* full matter effects (-> th34) or
include electron neutrinos, but not both.

- Quantify tensions within the appearance data
--> Done, plot is in the paper (currently fig. 7)


Important changes
-----------------

2013-01-25  Include matter effects in MINOS
