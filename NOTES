- Understand why including ATM_COMP rather than ATM_TAB changes the PG
  test by so much.

- RENO ND spectrum?

- Understand differences between my MINOS code and Michele's

- MINOS seems to have large impact on tension in 3+2, but not so much
in 3+1, see Thomas' email from Sep 23, 2011, 8:30 am.

- Try to understand good PG for app vs. disapp in the 1+3+1 case (but
not the 3+2 case)

- Quantify tensions within the appearance data

- Understand why null-app results seem to prefer, at low confidence,
non-zero theta

- Study consistency of app and disapp evidence, e.g. by plotting chi^2
marginalized vs. dmsq.

- Understand why solar is more constraining for th13 than for th14.
(Matter effects?)

parameter counting in Thomas' simulation:
-----------------------------------------

available parameters:
  Ue4
  Um4
  Ue5
  Um5
  \delta
  dm41
  dm51
(Ue3 is kept fixed at zero)

LSND+MBanti measure two mixing angles, two dm^2's, one phase
the rest measures Ue4, Um4, Ue5, Um5, dm41, dm51, one phase

Appearance measures two mixing angles, two dm^2's, one phase
Disappearance measures Ue4, Um4, Ue5, Um5, dm41, dm51



Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------

- Differences of our results compared to Giunti-Laveder:
--> see my email from 2012-06-12

- Using Thomas' code, "all except KamLAND" gives worse limit than
SBL+BUGEY_SP. Is this related to th13 fixed? Plot in th13-th14 plane
for fixed dm41?
--> It appears that some of the LBL reactor experiments have a preference
for *larger* th14. I tried setting th13 to 0, and the preferred region
for "all except KamLAND" moves to even larger th14 (by a small amount).
Plotting the allowed region in th13 vs th14 (for dm41 = 5. eV^2) does not
reveal anything unusual.
